Bootcamp Module 15 Homework Challenge using Leaflet for Mapping

## Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Objectives
- Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualisation
- Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional with no extra points earning)

## Output
- [static/css/style.css](./static/css/style.css) Local css file which contains some additional formatting for legend
- [static/js/logic.js](./static/js/logic.js) Javascript logic for leaflet mapping
- [static/data/plates.json](./static/data/plates.json) GeoJSON file containing additional tectonic boundary information
- [index.html](index.html) Main html for map display.
